# Vactrol_Enclosure

## What are vactrols ?

Vactrols are optocouplers.

It's a LED (Light Emitting Diode) and a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)

A led can generate light progressively between no light and full light.

An LDR is sensitive to light, and its internal resistance varies when illuminated. The more light it receives, the lower its internal resistance.

When you mold an LED and a LDR in resin or place an LED and an LDR in a 3D printed tube or Heat-shrink tubing, you get a Vactrol.

In other words, you have a resistance that you can vary by turning the LED on more or less.

Ready-made vactrols are available on the market, but sometimes quite expensive ...

But it's also possible to make your own, that's what this directory is for. :)

There are LEDS with flat heads and others with rounded heads.

Vactrols are available with one LED and one LDR or with one LED and 2 LDRs.


## In the 3D files folder you will find 2 differents type of files:

.stl : the files for a 3D printer

.fcstd : the file for freecad (3D parametric modeler : https://www.freecad.org/) if you want to modify them

### Single LDR and Single Led (Flat Top) (VTL5C3 for example)

LED_1Led1LDR_F : Part for the led

LDR_1Led1LDR : Part for LDR

TUBE_1Led1LDR : The tube

### Single LDR and Single Led (Rounded Head) (VTL5C3 for example)

LED_1Led1LDR_R : Part for the led

LDR_1Led1LDR : Part for LDR

TUBE_1Led1LDR : The tube

### Dual LDR and Single led (Rounded Head) (VTL5C3/2 for example)

LED_1Led2LDR : Part for the led
