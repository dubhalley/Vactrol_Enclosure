# Vactrol_Enclosure


Vactrols are optocouplers.

It's a LED (Light Emitting Diode) and a LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)

A led can generate light progressively between no light and full light.

An LDR is sensitive to light, and its internal resistance varies when illuminated. The more light it receives, the lower its internal resistance.

When you mold an LED in resin, you get a Vactrol. You could also place an LED and an LDR in a tube or Heat-shrink tubing, you get a Vactrol.

In other words, you have a resistance that you can vary by turning the LED on more or less.

Ready-made vactrols are available on the market, but sometimes quite expensive ...

But it's also possible to make your own, that's what this directory is for. :)

There are LEDS with flat heads and others with rounded heads.

Vactrols are available with one LED and one LDR or with one LED and 2 LDRs.


## In the 3D files folder you will find 2 differents type of files:

.stl : the files for a 3D printer
.fcstd : the file for freecad (3D parametric modeler : https://www.freecad.org/)

### Single LDR and Single Led (Flat Top) (VTL5C3 for example)
